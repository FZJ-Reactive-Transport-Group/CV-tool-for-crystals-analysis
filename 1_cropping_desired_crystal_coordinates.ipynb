    "In this script, you have the capability to interactively select areas of interest within images using the mouse. Here's how you can do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Selecting crystals coordinates**:\n",
    "   - When an image is displayed, you can use your mouse to draw rectangles around the area you wish to process.\n",
    "   - To start drawing a rectangle, move your mouse cursor to one corner of the desired area and press the left mouse button.\n",
    "   - While holding the left mouse button down, drag the cursor to the opposite corner of the area.\n",
    "   - Release the left mouse button to complete the rectangle. The selected area will now be encapsulated in a rectangular outline.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multiple Selections**:\n",
    "   - If you need to select more than one area in the same image, simply repeat the above steps. Each new rectangle will be added to your selections.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Proceeding to Next Image**:\n",
    "   - Once you have finished selecting areas on the current image, you can move to the next image by pressing the 'n' key on your keyboard.\n",
    "   - The script will then save your selections for the current image and display the next image for you to process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, these interactions are crucial for the script to correctly identify and process the areas of interest in your images. Take your time to accurately select the areas you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: If you make a mistake in drawing a rectangle, you will need to restart the selection process for the current image, as this script does not support undoing the last action.\n"
